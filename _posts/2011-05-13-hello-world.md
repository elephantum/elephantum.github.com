title: Hello world!

Hello, world! [GitHub](http://github.com/) finally provides nerds best publishing platform ever. I, as a proud nerd, could not help, but join the fun.

Actually there was an unresolved tension about where to put my highly technical posts, which would be appreciated by very narrow set of my friends. I was caring too much about world entropy to create host yet another blog, but here it requires such a minimal effort, that it was worth trying.

Also I really appreciate this combination of git repository, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) and GitHub online file editor. This is something, that I had in mind for some time as a lowest friction platform.
